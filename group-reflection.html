                                At the start of this assignment we had trouble getting enough people to create a group. Once that was achieved, it took a week or so for the team to get organised as we are split across multiple time zones with different outside commitments. When we got up and running it all seemed to run smoothly.  Everyone had a role to play and the work was divided amongst the team members during our first official meeting. This worked well as it allowed each member to concentrate on one particular part of the puzzle rather than scattered across multiple tasks.  We attended a team meeting twice a week which allowed us to keep updated with the status of each part of the project and voice any concerns that anyone had.
                            </p>   
                            <p>
                                Part way through the project we lost a team member, but were unaware until a few days later.  To the teams credit, we took it in our stride and distributed the team members work withing the team to get completed. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I would like to thank ALL the members of the team for their hard work and determination in getting this project completed despite some delays and short notice changes. 
                            </p>

                                The Magpie group consists of students from different states. Almost all of us are full-time workers, yet we still managed to attend team meetings while simultaneously accommodating to each other’s state time differences. After all the obstacles and time constraints, our group still managed to finish A2, which is what went well. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Communication is an aspect of our group that needs to be improved. Lack of communication can reduce the quality of our work and our efficiency. One of our members withdrew from the course, which we only confirmed towards the end of our assignment. This then affected our time management, having to distribute larger portions of the task and complete them in a short period of time.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The surprising part while doing A2 was, when one member of our group disappeared without informing us. The group keep on messaging her via MS Teams and Outlook, yet we received nothing from her. The group only learned that she withdrew from the course when two of our members asked the course tutor. We got through this with determination and resilience.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After years of being away from the workforce, I could not imagine myself being in a group again. At first, I was a bit hesitant to go through the whole experience again, but throughout the assignment I began to feel more comfortable with my group and the environment. Being in a group is not easy as you need to deliberate over things, sharing your opinions to create something you all agree on. However, at the end of the process, I feel fulfilment and accomplished. Establishing teamwork is crucial to complete the assignment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Completing this assignment would not be possible without GitHub and MS Teams. All our assigned tasks were uploaded through these platforms and if any group members had questions about the task, we could easily collaborate. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is what I think reflects our group’s work on this assignment.

                                All the 5 members that stayed till the end in our group were willing to work towards the same goal, completing the assignment. We were all eager to set up Microsoft teams and keep communicating and attending meetings, also committing to their part of the work and delivering in a reasonable time. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Overall communication could've been improved, the group initially had 6 members but 1 of the members left the course without communicating, we spend 2 weeks without hearing from her, we tried emailing her and messaging on Ms Teams without hearing a response.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What was surprising was, we acted fast after it came to our knowledge one of the members had withdrawn from the group, 2 of the members were able to do the member's part of the work to complete the assignment. 
                            </p>

                                I learnt that groups are fun, when I first read the whole assignment, it seemed to be impossible to complete, but when we divided it into parts and shared the work it was rather feasible, also it was great having more people to discuss the assignment with.

                                GitHub is a great tool, enabling us to post the website online and allowing collaboration between team members, in this particular assignment we used more MS Teams, setting up 2 meetings per week, both tools are great and vital for the completion of our Assignment 2.

                                The start of this assignment 2 was a bit confused for me as I did not have any groups and was still getting the way this course works. After I got invited to join group 10 it was very exciting as it would be the first time, I would meet different people that are chasing the same path as me. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It took a little while for us to get together and the times were different as we have people from all around Australia. Finally, we booked the meeting accordingly to a time that would suit everybody and since that day I could feel that I would fit perfectly in the group. Joao gave us the name idea which I liked, Sunil was always very kind and helpful with everybody and straight away gave us the option that he would do the website part as he enjoys it, Alex was the most experienced in the field and started to lead the group on a way that everybody would enjoy and feel confident on what we would do. Jacqueline was helpful and present in the meetings giving us the confidence that she would be competent on her part of the work.     
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We also had another person in the group that left without telling us and straight away we could arrange the time for a meeting and discusses who would do her part so we could still have time to finish the A2 on time.   
                            </p>

                                I found that this group was very helpful to each other, and we work well together. Many thanks.

                                Being just the second assignment, it was very challenging getting to know what was required. But as the group was formed and we started communicating, it became clear to what we had to do. We started a bit late due to the logistics of getting the group formed. Once that was out, we had an initial meeting to outline what we had to do. Our group had a good mix of people with different skills and hence we were able to get the work done. We broke the assignment into different sections and the team put their hand forward to take on sections in the assignment to champion. Alex with his experience with IT took hold of running our meetings, did the Industry Data section and updating his project to be in line with the feedback he had received. Raul put his hand up being the author of the complete PDF document for submission. Joao did the Technologies section with conducting the interview which was in 2 different time zones. Jacqueline did the transcribing of the interview and helped in the Technologies section.

                                We lost a member of our group towards the critical time of the assignment. We had some tasks that were assigned. Unfortunately, these things happen and at this time in the course, people move out. It was sad that we were not informed and hoped out messages would be replied. Fortunately for a group that worked together well, the team chipped in and took on tasks that were pending and ensure we completed our assignment.

                                We used Teams as our main communication portal, as that is on phones and PC’s and has video and group chat. GitHub was used to keep the articles that needed to link to the website. The group members were able to update as required and these could be pushed.
