                                At the beginning of this assignment, we started late due to team members work 
                                commitments and sickness. Once started, the whole project started to flow well 
                                however, we found that we needed to spend a lot of time on it as we had to make up 
                                for lost time. Again, everyone has been outstanding with their effort and work 
                                produced. Team meetings were attended twice weekly with 4 meetings being held in 
                                the last 7 days of the project. When a team member was unable to attend a meeting 
                                or had trouble with their piece of work, everyone rolled up their sleeves to get the job 
                                done.
                            </p>   
                            <p>
                                I am proud to have worked as a member of this team of highly motivated and 
                                likeable people. I can’t stress enough how important everyone was in the completion 
                                of this assignment.

                                The Magpie group is made up of individuals from several states. Despite the 
                                challenges and time constraints, our group successfully completed A3. 
 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Communication is not an issue in our group. If our group does not communicate 
                                well, it may have a detrimental impact on the quality and efficiency of our work. 
                                Fortunately, we can still communicate despite the time difference.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The most surprise aspect of completing A3 was that even though some members of 
                                our group became unwell, we still managed to complete the tasks assigned to us. 
                                We got through it with courage and perseverance.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I couldn't see myself not being a part of this group. I was first hesitant to replicate 
                                the entire experience, but as A2 progressed to A3, I became more at ease with my 
                                group and the setting. Being in a group is difficult because you must debate over 
                                things and share your thoughts to produce something which everyone can agree on. 
                                I felt accomplished at the end of the process.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Without GitHub and Microsoft Teams, it would be impossible to complete this 
                                task. All our allocated work were posted to these platforms, and if any of the group 
                                members had issues about the task, we were able to simply collaborate. I am 
                                extremely thankful for the valuable things and experiences I have learned about from 
                                being a part of the Magpie group.

                                Our group has improved in communicating with each other and we got to know each 
                                other a bit better, the ability to work as a team helping when one teammate fell 
                                behind during this assignment went well, what could be improved was we could've 
                                started a bit earlier so we wouldn't be so overworked and rushed the last week of 
                                assignment. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well, it was surprising that some of us missed meetings due to sickness or shift 
                                work, or in my case from being exhausted from work, but when that happened, the 
                                other team members were able to continue work, delegate tasks and help with any 
                                questions.

                                I've learnt that is important to start early, as I’ve done the "risks" part, I came to the 
                                realization we sometimes underestimate the length of the project, staying behind 
                                then rushing to finish in time, in our case we have done very well, by finishing up a 
                                day earlier. Microsoft Teams made it possible to collaborate, communicate and 
                                record meetings, also GitHub is where we can collaborate with the website and host 
                                it online.

                                As we went through assignment 2 and the team worked very well together, we had in 
                                mind what everyone could do and each one’s expertise. In assignment 3 it was not 
                                different, we had some issues on the way with student mates getting sick, I had my 
                                work hours changed and it became very hard to be on the meetings and to get my 
                                time management back in place. It was hard to get it started but once we did, I had 
                                the feeling that everything was going to be okay, as I know I can trust each one of us 
                                to get our parts done in time.

                                The Idea behind this Project came from Alex, and it has a massive potential to be a 
                                good initiative, as we are going pass a Worldwide pandemic, everyone is feeling how 
                                hard it is to attend to a doctor's appointment and how technology is being very 
                                important for the society in these very critical times. I am very happy to be part of the 
                                Magpies and very proud of each one of us, again the effort and the hard work of 
                                every one of us will be worth it.

                                Our group performed well in completing Assignment 2 due to constraints beyond our 
                                control. This made the group members closer to each other working towards a 
                                common goal. We were provided great feedback on our assignment which helped 
                                us to improve on areas that we needed to.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The project we have chosen for our group was identified by Alex in Assignment 2. It 
                                is a unique application which will have a big impact on society once fully functional. 
                                It has the potential to be used across other nations specially where treatment and 
                                medical practitioners are barely available.
                            </p>    
                            <p>
                                Our group works together well when we have a defined goal and have defined tasks. 
                                We identified this on our last assignment and hence we divided this massive 
                                assignment into the various sub tasks and assigned them to team members. Our 
                                project plan and team meetings helped us keep us on track.
                            </p>
                             <p>
                                In doing the detailed analysis of this project, we realised how appropriate the career 
                                plans of the group lined up with the project resource requirements. This would help 
                                us work into our spheres of interest and progress into future employment.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                                The Magpies group has a can-do attitude. All team members contribute to their 
                                maximum potential even though there are other day to day commitments and 
                                distractions. 
                             </p>
                             <p>
                                Having Teams and using it well was very useful for the group and for our meetings 
                                and communicating ideas. It was also our main repository for storage of artifacts 
                                and documents. GitHub was used for the creation of the website. We could not fork 
                                the Assignment 2 website, so we had to clone it.

                                The Magpies group worked hard to get this assignment completed within the 
                                timelines. There was a bit of confusion with the Assignment 5 dates that caused us 
                                to panic, but we achieved the completion by reshuffling our activities  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We learnt about the group from assignment 2 and hence it was easy for us to quickly 
                                build up a Gantt Chart and assign activities to names. We planned to start early but 
                                due to work commitments we had a bit of delay in getting started. This team works 
                                together well and copes up quite well when under pressure. This is attributed to the 
                                diverse age group and the experience of the people in the group. It is a lively group 
                                and meeting are enjoyable. We have had good attendance given the time difference 
                                and the locations. When people are not available there is always communication and 
                                our recordings have helped those absent to see what was discussed and get back on 
                                track. As a group this assignment has thought us a lot of new items and this will 
                                improve our knowledge and skills as we progress through our IT journey.
    
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most of our time was spent on the project and collecting information about how we 
                                could make the project successful. We did not use GitHub to the full extent, as
                                Teams was used instead. Teams was easy to use and having access to Teams on 
                                the phone gave the group the flexibility to review and check what was being done by 
                                the group.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The item of improvement if we are to carry out another assignment, would be to do a 
                                look ahead plan earlier than what we currently did. This would have given us more 
                                time on the assignment and would have been less stressful to the group. However, 
                                there was no compromise to the content that was produced by the group.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The surprising thing in doing this assignment was identifying the steps that we 
                                required to get the application built and into production. There is a lot of work that 
                                goes into development and launch of an application. It gave us an appreciation of 
                                the work IT professional do and at the same time gave the group more confidence 
                                that this was an achievable target. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The one thing that we all learned working together was that for the group to be 
                                successful, each member of the group must know what is required and have an 
                                insight into the other persons work. This helps take over in case a member is not 
                                available to carry out their tasks. Hence as a group we must learn from each other 
                                and impart our knowledge to the group, so that together we become successful.
