                                In Assignment 2, the group selected a project to create a mobile application for 
                                visitations for medical professionals. The mobile app would allow the user to obtain 
                                medical advice and service remotely using audio and video consultations. Having 
                                done a brainstorming session with the group and given the difficulties getting 
                                appointments booked at doctors, commuting to the doctor’s premises, the group 
                                decided that this was the most appropriate application the group should focus on for 
                                this assignment.    
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The mobile app matched the career plans of the group which included two Software 
                                Developers and one Web Developer who together would work on the development of 
                                the app, improvements and gain more insight and knowledge to work towards 
                                making this app a niche product in the market. The IT Support would work on the 
                                support requirements of the app and provide assist with the testing and deployment 
                                into Production. The Data Analyst would provide support in the planning, costing and 
                                reporting of the project along with database skills to ensure the application has a 
                                sound data model.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The finished product will be a mobile application that will run on Android or iOS. It 
                                will integrate with smart watches and smart scales to provide medical staff a clear 
                                medical snapshot of the patient to provide proper medical advice and dispense the 
                                right medication.
                                <br>The main features of the mobile app are listed below:

                    <p>
                        The Magpies group worked quite well in Assignment 2 coordinating the tasks 
                        amongst the group. We used Microsoft Teams as the main platform for 
                        conversations, chat between the members and as our storage repository for the 
                        documents we produced. It was a great tool to host meetings and make recordings 
                        so we could play it back later to check on what the conversations and action items 
                        were. We used the Canvas email inbox rarely at times. This was used mainly to 
                        communicate to the group just as a backup to ensure that every team member of the 
                        Magpies group got the message across to them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        GitHub Repository was used to store the documents and media items that were used 
                        for the website. The website was created using Visual Studio Code linked to GitHub 
                        Desktop. The members of the group were granted contributor access so that each 
                        member of the group had access to view and update code. This process worked 
                        quite well given we had the team spread across Australia in different time zones. 
                        Due to timing and access to team members, Word was used by the team to draft the 
                        deliverables for the website and later entered in GitHub.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our assignment 2 journey was a bit rocky at the start with the formation of the group 
                        taking a bit longer. This was due to initial communications and not having clear idea 
                        of who we would get to form the team. Once the team was decided and we had a 
                        view of who was in, a Microsoft Teams group was created and that made us more 
                        connected with each other. Unfortunately, one of the team members pulled out of 
                        the course towards the end and we had to quickly reformat the tasks assigned to 
                        ensure the assignment was completed by the deadline. Once we had official 
                        confirmation of the member was out of the course, the team took on extra tasks to 
                        ensure that this did not compromise to the assignment deadlines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As Assignment 3 used the same group as before, we were pretty much clear on what 
                        we had to do. We had learnt from the past to what skills the team had and how we 
                        could ensure this assignment needed to be done. Feedback received from the tutors 
                        helped us investigate items that required improvements. Due to the resource issue, 
                        we had in last assignment, we did a planning run early in the assignment to divide 
                        the workload amongst the group with the provision that there was help within the 
                        group if any individual was struggling. 
                        A Project plan has been created detailing the tasks that needed to be done. Two
                        meetings are held weekly to report progress and identify any shortfalls. Meeting 
                        minutes are stored on Teams for review on actions. Meetings notes, agendas and 
                        the project plan help us to keep the assignment work on track. Due to 3 
                        assignments due at the same time, it is critical for the group to keep track of what is 
                        complete and what needs focus.
