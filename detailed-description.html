                    <h1>Aims</h1>
                    
                    <div class="content-container">
                            
                        <p>
                            To utilize the least amount of time within a medical appointment without sacrificing quality by using smart devices to our advantage. Achieving our aim will make doctor’s visits convenient, easy and fast, by giving the doctor/patient more time available to focus on the consult instead of wasting important time on other details.    
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For us to reach our aim we need to break down a doctor’s appointment in a few steps. From ringing to make an appointment, dislocating to the clinic’s location, waiting to see the doctor, providing physical data like blood pressure, ECG, weight, body mass and gathering history data and information about a patient. Each of these steps consumes time, so we will set our goals to shorten or extinguish the average time to complete these tasks by integrating digital solutions through our mobile phone app.
                        </p>
                        
                            <h3>Goals</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>To eliminate travel and waiting time:</b> by making video and audio appointments available in our app. With this function the patient won’t need to leave their house to have a consultation, saving travel and waiting time also making a doctor’s appointment convenient and easy. The fact that this patient is at home and there’s one less car on the road also helps our planet, reducing our carbon footprint.</li>
                                <li><b>To be able to send digital prescriptions and referrals:</b> We can add to our app standard prescriptions and referrals that can be sent digitally to the patient or straight to the pharmacy where the patient can then collect. Some people need to make regular appointments just to get prescription medication, for these people having our request referral/prescription function in our app will save them a lot of time.</li> 
                                <li><b>Using smart devices to do regular physical check-ups:</b> This is a glimpse into the future where IoT devices will be interconnected talking to each other. In our health app, we plan to get any smart devices that collect personal data like digital watches, digital scales and use them towards inputting patients’ data into our appointment. By doing this our health professionals will not need to spend time doing physical check-ups.</li>
                                <li><b>Having digital patient’s history data available for health professionals:</b> Having all the data, the professional needs right in front of them can help the appointment quality, saving the doctor or front desk from having to call or email other clinics to chase the patient’s medical history.</li>
                               
                            </ul> 
                        <p>      
                                To identify the most important parts of the project, that will have priority over the others we need to look closely at our aim, which is to consume less time. Considering the biggest chunk of time from a patient’s point of view is wasted in dislocation (in some cases it takes longer to travel to the clinic’s location than the appointment itself) our priority will be setting up video/audio appointments and digital prescriptions/referrals. 
                        </p>

                            The project will design and implement the mobile application described in the project description which in short is an application that will assist with interacting with medical professionals.  To achieve the desired project outcome, the project will need to complete the following tasks:     
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3>1. Create a Figma application prototype</h3>
                        <p>
                            The project will build a Figma application prototype showing the screens and options that will be available in the finished product.  This will give the project team, stakeholders, and potential investors a clear understanding of how the product will look and feel.  This is an important step as without the prototype, the product is open to different interpretations from different teams/individuals which can lead to members of the project team working towards slightly different end targets. 
                            <br>
                            Using Figma prototypes allows for testing concepts and provides an interactive demonstration of what the application will look and feel like from the UI perspective.[1] 

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The finished product will be a mobile application that will run on Android or iOS. It will integrate with smart watches and smart scales to provide medical staff a clear medical snapshot of the patient to provide proper medical advice and dispense the right medication.
                        </p>

                    <h3>2. Identify resources and begin sourcing/recruiting</h3>
                        <p>
                            The project has identified that it will require: 
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Network Engineer</b> – The network engineer is required to install and configure the firewalls, routers, and switches.  This should be a highly skilled engineer with extensive experience in all technologies being implemented at the network layer. [2] </li>
                            <li><b>OpenStack Specialist</b> – OpenStack can be a complicated piece of software to install and configure if you are un-familiar with it.  The project will need to source an experienced OpenStack specialist to provide this service. [2] </li>
                            <li><b>Senior Storage Engineer</b> – The storage engineer is required to install and configure the storage arrays along with the fibre switches. [2] </li>
                            <li><b>Hardware installers</b> – These are required to install all the hardware into racks prior to work being commenced on the configuration.  This can be completed by the engineers responsible for the technology being installed, so network equipment by the network engineers, storage and fibre switches by the storage engineer, and a generic level 2 engineer to install the servers. [2] </li>
                            <li><b>A Flutter developer or MIT App Inventor Specialist</b> – This resource is required to develop the app itself.   [2] </li>

                            <li><b>Database administrator</b> – There will be a huge amount of data stored on the platform over time and as such will need a database administrator with enterprise level experience in design and administration of complex database systems. [2] </li>
                            <li><b>Security advisor</b> – A security advisor will be required to advise on potential security issues relating to all aspects of the project.  They should not only highlight the possible issues but also determine the best solution to protect against those issues.</li> 
                         </ul>
                    <h3>3. Prepare Communications Plan</h3>
                         <p>
                            “A project communication plan is an agreement between collaborators and stakeholder that outlines what, when and how information will be shared at key intervals.  Information like status updates, task-related questions, and meeting details should all be included in this written guide.  The goal is to define and streamline team communications as much as possible.” [3] 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                            As per the above description of a project plan, and to ensure good communications and engagement a plan has been created. The communication and engagement plan will raise awareness and understanding of the application, assist with resistance to change, promote utilisation of the app to assist with speed of adoption and encourage dialogue and two way communications between the relevant parties. For the project to be successful, we must achieve the following:
                         </p>
                         <ul>
                            <li>Identify key collaborators/stakeholders in the project both internal and external noting contact details and their location.</li> 
                            <li>Inform key stakeholders of what is happening, when it is happening, why and how it will affect them and their organisation. </li>
                            <li>How they can participate in the process and help us improve.</li>
                            <li>Reach the right people at the right time, in the right way with the right message.</li>
                            <li>Provide an avenue for questions and feedback.</li>

                         </ul>
                         <p>

                    <h3>4. Prepare data model for the project</h3>
                         <p>
                            A data model will be prepared by the DBA, software developers, security advisor and the major stakeholders in the project.  Data models visually present an enterprise’s data elements and how they connect to each other.  Data models support the development of effective information systems and enable business and technical resources to collaborate on how the data will be stored, accessed, shared, updated, and used. [4] 
                         </p>
                    
                    <h3>5. Prepare security audit and requirements</h3>
                         <p>
                            Because of the extremely personal nature of the data being stored and the fact that it will be accessed over the internet (although this will be encrypted), the project demands that the data be as secure as possible.  To this end, the security advisor will perform a security audit and assist the implementors to satisfy the security requirements of the platform.
                         </p>
                    <h3>6. Prepare network map and identify requirements</h3>
                         <p>
                            A network map will be drawn up as part of the project.  This will communicate the infrastructure layout and how it is all connects in a visual presentation which will enable everyone on the project to get a good understanding of how everything fits together.  It will also be a valuable artifact for the support team after the project is complete.  
                         </p>
                    
                    <h3>7. Identify DBA and storage requirements</h3>
                         <p>
                            After the engineer roles have been filled, they will need to get together to ascertain the database and storage requirements.  The OpenStack specialist, Storage Engineer, Flutter/MIT App developer, Linux Engineer, PHP developer and DBA will all have to be involved in determining the storage requirements, with the DBA and developers working on the database requirements. 
                         </p>

                         <h3>5. Prepare security audit and requirements</h3>

                    <h3>8. Obtain quotes for hardware and software</h3>
                         <p>
                            Quotes for the hardware, software licences, network links, and rack space will need to be obtained prior to any physical work being performed.  When obtaining the quotes, consideration needs to be made to the lead time for delivery of the items quoted on.  We will go to market and request quotes from 3 different suppliers for each piece of technology.  The lowest quote that can provide the items will be selected.  
                         </p>
                    
                    <h3>9. Create purchase orders</h3>
                         <p>
                            Once the quotes have been finalised and agreed upon, the project will raise purchase orders and despatch them to relevant vendors within 1 working day.  
                         </p>

                    <h3>10. Receive goods </h3>
                         <p>
                            Once the goods have been received, they will all have to be checked for completeness, and then assembled and powered on to the initial configuration stage to ensure that the products are functioning as would be expected.  This part will be completed by the engineers responsible for each product.   
                         </p>

                         <h3>6. Prepare network map and identify requirements</h3>
                         <p>
                            A network map will be drawn up as part of the project.  This will communicate the infrastructure layout and how it is all connects in a visual presentation which will enable everyone on the project to get a good understanding of how everything fits together.  It will also be a valuable artifact for the support team after the project is complete.  
                         </p>
                    
                    <h3>11. Setup firewalls, router, and switches </h3>
                         <p>
                            The network equipment will be setup and configured by the network engineer with input from the security advisor.  The network configuration will consist of 4 four CheckPoint firewalls configured in a failover cluster.  CheckPoint firewalls were chosen for their ease of configuration and scalability (up to 52 firewalls) [5].  Beneath the firewalls in the stack will be 2 Cisco network routers in a failover configuration [2].  The routers will connect to the internal network switches which will be Cisco Catalyst 3750 stack switches [6].  The switches will be directly connected to the servers running OpenStack.   
                         </p>

                    <h3>12. Build servers and load OS</h3>
                         <p>
                            The physical servers being used in the project are Dell PowerEdge R830 rack servers which were chosen because they are designed for virtualisation, with 4 CPU sockets, and 48 DIMM slots for up to 64GB DDR4 RAM in each slot [2].  The servers will be built and have the OS loaded onto them by the OpenStack specialist to ensure the base configuration meets the best practices for OpenStack. 
                            <br>
                            The virtual servers will be built and configured by the Linux Engineer.  At the initial implementation stage of the project, there will be 6 virtual machines, 2 each for databases, front-end web, and the backend API’s.  Each pair of servers will be configured in high availability failover clusters.  This approach allows for easy scaling as the virtual machines can be cloned and running in production within minutes. 

                         </p>
                    <h3>13. Setup storage</h3>
                         <p>
                            The storage appliances chosen for this project are TrueNAS storage appliances which will be configured in a high availability cluster.  The underlying disks of the storage arrays will be configured in RAID 6 disk arrays.  The ZFS file system will be used to format the storage pools on the disks.  ZFS is a widely used filesystem in the *nix world and has snapshot and replication capabilities.  In addition to the afore mentioned, TrueNAS allows the running of Linux containers which can be used to run services such as Apache2 [2].     
                         </p>
                    
                    <h3>14. Setup OpenStack</h3>
                         <p>
                            The setup of OpenStack will be performed by the OpenStack specialist.  Five servers will be used for OpenStack, 2 for the management of the OpenStack environment and 3 for backend services.  This can be expanded in the future should the need arise.   
                         </p>

                    <h3>15. Configure web servers </h3>
                         <p>
                            The web servers will also be configured by the Linux Engineer with input from the Security advisor.  The web servers will be Apache2 running on Ubuntu OS.    
                         </p>
                    <h3>16. Configure databases </h3>
                         <p>
                            The DBA will use the data model to configure the databases.  The Security advisor will assist as this is the critical data of patients that cannot be exploited under any circumstances.  A breach of client information would most likely end the App due to a suffering reputation and possible legal implications including being taken to court for damages.    
                         </p>

                            While doing the preliminary feasibility planning for the project, the following key roles were identified. Some of these roles will be hard to recruit and keep on the project and hence will be outsourced. Roles that require detailed investigation and had a high configuration aspect to it will be recruited. This will allow the application build processes to be bedded in and the outcome would that which would make this project successful. Hardware installation will be outsourced to third party vendors who may provide lease of hardware and space for the initial period until the application is setup and clients sourced. The below roles are identified and explained in detail below.

                        <h1>Scope and Limits</h1>
                        <a href="#Home">Back to Top</a>
                        <div class="content-container">
                                
                            <p>
                                Scope is the division of work to be performed inside the project, no matter if the job is being done internally or outsourced. It must be a Scope, so the team and professionals are working on the same page.
                                <br>
                                One of the biggest issues when working on a team is often caused by discrepancies between peers, and to avoid that a scope is created.
                                As part of the scoping, the project team will list out what is to be excluded and not part of the build. This provides a clear boundary of what the project scope entails.
                                <br>
                                The project team will list down the assumptions made. These provide a sounding board if any issues arise.
                                In this case our scope consists in:
                                <br>
                                <h3>What needs to be done?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    It appears to be an easy answer, but when dealing with a big project and a large team with lots of different areas, the project must be divided per skills and professionals that are able to develop and make the App run. 
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>How should it be done?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Yes, this is very important to get the project running smooth, if one member of the team uses a different software than the rest of the team, it could be a big problem down the track once everything is put together. A plan and instructions on how the job need to be done is crucial for the project success.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>How long should it take?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    A time frame must be set. Anything can happen when dealing with technology, people can get sick and even leave the job on the middle of the project, for that reason a time frame and deadlines should be set on the start of the project to make sure that problems that comes up through it can be sorted on time.
                                    <br>
                                    Limits are very hard to set, it can depend on the risks, budget, professional skills, and market acceptance. Scope also tends to define limits to what lengths we should go to.
                                    <br>All projects have risks, but inside the scope a limit for those risks should be set (our risk appetite), for example if there is a risk of fraud or data leak inside the App, a budget for Cyber Security is set and if the team thinks that it is too expensive for the project there is a limit.
                                    <br>
                                    Or if there is a lack of professionals available on the market and the existing staff is not enough to finish by a deadline, a limit is placed.
                                    <br>
                                    One of the limits when building the projects would be a device target, for example if the data analysis shows that this type of App is mostly used in Mobile phones, we would set a limit that users can only download from Apps on a mobile device, excluding errors that could occur when downloading the App in a Tablet for example.
                                    <br>
                                    Limitations on budget would also be welcomed once the prototype is ready and tested, so we would know how we would make money on the App and if the figures could give us a profit.

                                </p>
   
                            </p>

                                        When it comes to developing an App, testing the project is one of the most important steps for success. It is the part of the scope where you can see the weakness of the project and fix the issues you have before investing time and money on it.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        There are many types of tests that can be performed on Mobile Applications. On the technical and developing aspects, usability, compatibility, interface, services, performance and security testing are the main ones when developing an App the will be launched and used by a large portion of the community, these tests would ensure that the App is easy to use and provides a good user experience, if it works on different devices, screens and operational systems, if all the menu and buttons are working accordingly, if it will work in different connections like 3G, 4G, 5G and Wi-Fi, if it uses the device battery in excess and if it needs some sort of log-in, validation and the system protects the data or not.
                                    </p>
                                        
                                    <p>
                                        Once the technical part is running smooth, it is now time to check if real users are happy with it. You can start small and tell some friends and family to download your App and try to use it and give you feedback, or even check how similar Apps are being accept on the OS storer, that will also give you an idea of the issues and ideas that users are having when looking at the feedbacks.
                                    </p>    
                                    
                                    <p>
                                        As our App involves medical practices and Doctors as well as the patients, three tests would be essential for the App. If a doctor cannot use it correctly the patient would have misleading information as well as the opposite. Thinking about it testing in a small Medical Centre would be the best for this purpose, the app would be available for the staff and the patients of that practice and from there the feedbacks would be constructive so it can escalate for more people and places.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If the budget agrees that are some companies that offer a testing program doing paid survey.
                                    </p>

                                            The Magpies group chose Microsoft Teams as our repository for storing documents, scheduling meetings, and communicating among group members. We were able to transition between different communication modalities on this platform, such as video conferencing, instant messaging, document collaboration, and file sharing. It also functioned as a reminder calendar. Meetings were organised by Teams, and each meeting had a designated individual who took minutes. The meetings were recorded so that we could go back, watch, and listen to what we discussed. Meeting minutes were posted to the Teams folders. Teams was used as a collaboration tool to discuss concerns and receive peer reviews of the assigned task, throughout A2, A3, and A5. The group met twice a week using Teams meetings. Chats and individual conversations are help between group members to discuss their work and obtain feedback. On the final week of the assignment, we decided to have daily catch-up meetings to ensure we are also finalising the work to be submitted. Teams is available on phones and PC’s and hence formed the best tool to use. It also helps when you are on the move as your mobile device is always with you.

                                            Our meetings were recorded in Teams so members who were not available could watch the recording and identify what transpired and work out what needed to be done prior to the next meeting.

                                            The Magpies also used GitHub as a collaboration platform. When one of our group members wanted to incorporate one of his or her tasks into the group leader's repository or on a Word document, we used this as a Pull Request. Furthermore, if a team member is unable to continue working due to a challenging issue, he or she can send a pull request for assistance to the rest of the team.
                                        </p>

                                            Good communication includes going above and beyond to achieve progress. Checking in with your group members requires more than just making sure they're doing their best. When it come to an assigned task, your group members may appear productive, but they may later announce that they have given up. When this happens, the gap takes longer to close. Hence if you check in with the group members on a regular basis and address concerns, you can resolve them before they become major issues.

                                            When we move to the build phase of the project, we will use the same methodology. Initial stages there will be frequent meetings held to bed the process and identify requirements and document processes. We have built a Communications and Engagement plan which will be used to provide communications within the development team and externally.  Our commercial and marketing resource will ensure the project is conveyed to potential clients so that to gain an insight into where our focus would be in future.
