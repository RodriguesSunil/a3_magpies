Everyone’s ideal job is shown below along with the number of positions advertised and where the roles rank regarding advertised positions in 2018 according to Burning Glass

                        <p>
                            We can see from the above that Software Developer is by far the most in demand job from all the ideal jobs of the group.  Data analyst comes second with around half the advertised positions as first placed software developer and IT support specialist has the least demand. Due to the volume of job titles listed in the Burning Glass document, the above does not represent a fair comparison because a job can have many different titles depending on who the employer is and we could get a better representation by grouping job titles into one job to remove what the industry would consider duplicate titles.  IT support specialist for instance can also be referred to as System Engineer (which is the number 4 in demand job on the list), Desktop Support, and many others.  The same applies to the development roles, an argument could be made that Mobile App Developer, Software Developer, and App Developer are very similar, with the differences being negligible.  According to joboutlook.gov.au, in 2018, all the groups ideal roles had a very strong outlook <sup>2</sup>.

                            To identify a set of required skills we have put Mobile App Developer, Software Developer, and App Developer under the umbrella of ‘Programming’, as they practically duplicated each other. We used the Burning Glass data to identify the following:

                            From this summary we can see that the majority of the general skills in demand are required for all jobs which demonstrates that general skills are in high demand and considered imported to employers.  The IT Specific skills is slightly different with a range from 47% to 83%.  We wonder if it is a case of the fewer percent of IT specific skills required would indicate a specialised job whereas a higher percent indicates a more generalised role.
                            <br>
                            In relation to demand from employers, this indicates that there would be most demand for developers followed by IT Support Specialists and lastly Data Analysts.

                            The 3 general skills not required by the ideal jobs are identical for all 3, they are Business Management, Management, and English.

                            The only change I would make to my ideal job is that I would broaden the job description to software developer simply because that’s the role most in demand in the field I am aiming for.

                            Given the job market data shown and the differences in skills required between programming and data analyst, I would most likely upskill myself so that there are opportunities to sway either way. The skills in programming would enable me to work well in data analytics. It would give me a future pathway in Business Intelligence and data modelling also.

                            Based on the job market data, my ideal job has not changed. I would still like to become an IT Support Specialist. I can upskill my abilities by obtaining certifications and accreditations that align with my ideal job, but at the moment my knowledge is sufficient.

                            After all the research given, My position would not change, I would just also look into Software Developer because the demand is really high and it would be easier to try it when I start my IT career.
