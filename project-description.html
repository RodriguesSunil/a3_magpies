                            In Assignment 2, the group selected a project to create a mobile application for visitations for medical professionals. The mobile app would allow the user to obtain medical advice and service remotely using audio and video consultations. Having done a brainstorming session with the group and given the difficulties getting appointments booked at doctors, commuting to the doctor’s premises, the group decided that this was the most appropriate application the group should focus on for this assignment.    
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The mobile app matched the career plans of the group which included two Software Developers and one Web Developer who together would work on the development of the app, improvements and gain more insight and knowledge to work towards making this app a niche product in the market. The IT Support would work on the support requirements of the app and provide assist with the testing and deployment into Production. The Data Analyst would provide support in the planning, costing and reporting of the project along with database skills to ensure the application has a sound data model.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The finished product will be a mobile application that will run on Android or iOS. It will integrate with smart watches and smart scales to provide medical staff a clear medical snapshot of the patient to provide proper medical advice and dispense the right medication.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The main features of the mobile app are:

                        <h2>Topic</h2>
                        <p>
                            The number of available health "apps" has increased rapidly in recent years, driven by developments in technology and increased access to smartphones. Patients use their smartphones for a variety of purposes, but not nearly as often as they should for their health. Furthermore, while much work is still being done to develop, assess, and evaluate these apps, it is unclear how to properly integrate them into normal clinical practise. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We propose a project to create a cross-platform mobile app for doctors and patients who are not in an emergency condition. It provides a more convenient form of communication between doctors and patients, and it identifies the important issues that must be addressed before a visit. 
                        </p>
                    
                    </div>
                    <br>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Motivation</h2>
                        <p>
                            One of the members of our group has many medical conditions that demand regular doctor visits. Prescriptions or blood pressure checks account for around 65% of all visits. When he arrives at the clinical practice, he may have to wait anything from 10 minutes to up to an hour just to see the doctor. It only takes 10 minutes or less after being called to be seen by a doctor before being discharged. A routine appointment can take up to two hours of the day when travel time to and from the clinic is considered. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The proposed project is significant as it incorporates a system for scheduling appointments through video and voice. Once the appointment has been booked, you can provide the doctor with the relevant information. Simple data such as blood pressure, weight and body mass, temperature, and ECGs can be electronically transmitted to the app prior to their visit because the app is linked to smart scales and watches. Doctors will also be able to make referrals and prescriptions on request because they are already aware of a patient's health.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Every part of society is currently being changed by technology. Medical applications, for example, are increasing in popularity among healthcare           providers. As medical expenses continue to grow, many are actively looking for low-cost treatment options. This is complemented by a need for convenience; people do not want to wait in triage for a long period, nor do they want to waste time travelling long distances. Patients desire a balance between cost and convenience in a medical setting, and these diverse demands and balance can be accomplished by using these apps. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We believe that a mobile app like this will reduce the need for doctor visits, save time, and allow the doctor's clinical suite to be used for other important appointments. This application will also improve the flow and efficiency of medical environments in both urban and rural areas. 
                        </p>

                            One similar system for a hospital setting, is from Epic Systems, a healthcare software company, has collaborated with Apple to release iPhone and iPad versions of the Epic scheduling, billing, and clinical support app. PatientKeeper®,  Mobile Clinical Results gives doctors access to patient clinical data via Apple or Android mobile devices.

                                Since relevant information is stored in multiple applications, it is more difficult to access and requires multiple security tokens.  The key benefit on our app is that it will save all necessary information in a single app, which will make it more convenient and appealing to patients and healthcare providers. Also, it will be used in a private medical setting. It will require singular secure connections. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Development and validation are merely the first steps. We anticipate the development of additional apps, some of which will require confirmation of efficacy, regulatory approval, and integration into clinical practise before they can be used. 
                            </p>
