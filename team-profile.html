                        The Magpies group worked quite well in Assignment 2 coordinating the tasks 
                        amongst the group. We used Microsoft Teams as the main platform for 
                        conversations, chat between the members and as our storage repository for the 
                        documents we produced. It was a great tool to host meetings and make recordings 
                        so we could play it back later to check on what the conversations and action items 
                        were. We used the Canvas email inbox rarely at times. This was used mainly to 
                        communicate to the group just as a backup to ensure that every team member of the 
                        Magpies group got the message across to them.

                    <p>
                        GitHub Repository was used to store the documents and media items that were used 
                        for the website. The website was created using Visual Studio Code linked to GitHub 
                        Desktop. The members of the group were granted contributor access so that each 
                        member of the group had access to view and update code. This process worked 
                        quite well given we had the team spread across Australia in different time zones. 
                        Due to timing and access to team members, Word was used by the team to draft the 
                        deliverables for the website and later entered in GitHub.

                        Our assignment 2 journey was a bit rocky at the start with the formation of the group 
                        taking a bit longer. This was due to initial communications and not having clear idea 
                        of who we would get to form the team. Once the team was decided and we had a 
                        view of who was in, a Microsoft Teams group was created and that made us more 
                        connected with each other. Unfortunately, one of the team members pulled out of 
                        the course towards the end and we had to quickly reformat the tasks assigned to 
                        ensure the assignment was completed by the deadline. Once we had official 
                        confirmation of the member was out of the course, the team took on extra tasks to 
                        ensure that this did not compromise to the assignment deadlines.

                        As Assignment 3 used the same group as before, we were pretty much clear on what 
                        we had to do. We had learnt from the past to what skills the team had and how we 
                        could ensure this assignment needed to be done. Feedback received from the tutors 
                        helped us investigate items that required improvements. Due to the resource issue, 
                        we had in last assignment, we did a planning run early in the assignment to divide 
                        the workload amongst the group with the provision that there was help within the 
                        group if any individual was struggling. 
                        A Project plan has been created detailing the tasks that needed to be done. Two
                        meetings are held weekly to report progress and identify any shortfalls. Meeting 
                        minutes are stored on Teams for review on actions. Meetings notes, agendas and 
                        the project plan help us to keep the assignment work on track. Due to 3 
                        assignments due at the same time, it is critical for the group to keep track of what is 
                        complete and what needs focus.

                        During the assignment 2, the team compared their ideal jobs that they picked against 
                        Burning Glass data from 2018 advertised positions. Software Developer was the 
                        most advertised position in that period. From this review and when asked if any team 
                        member would consider updating their ideal job, Alex Hutton decided to broaden his 
                        ideal job to include Software Developer as this was in high demand and gave more 
                        prospects.
                        The key positions that the team were looking for were as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                        Comparing the learning styles to the types of jobs that the group selected, it can be 
                        noted that the positions were mainly in the Visual and Auditory type of style. The 
                        kinesthetics style was not prevalent in the jobs that were chosen by the group.

                        Information Technology requires people to have a good understanding of all the 
                        various processes and technologies that exist in the market. They need not be a 
                        master in all but need to have a good understanding of them whilst having a very
                        sound working knowledge of the ones that they use in their day to day working life. 
                        Having compared the ideal jobs that the Magpies team selected, there are quite a 
                        few similarities within the job requirements that those positions require. The skills in 
                        blue highlight are those that are common to all 3 positions within the group.
